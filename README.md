eos is a lightweight 3D Morphable Face Model fitting library that provides basic functionality to use face models, as well as camera and shape fitting functionality. It's written in modern C++17.

At the moment, it mainly provides the following functionality:

* MorphableModel and PcaModel classes to represent 3DMMs, with basic operations like `draw_sample()`. Supports the Surrey Face Model (SFM), 4D Face Model (4DFM), Basel Face Model (BFM) 2009 and 2017, and the Liverpool-York Head Model (LYHM) out-of-the-box
* The low-resolution, shape-only Surrey Face Model ([share/sfm_shape_3448.bin](https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos/blob/master/share/sfm_shape_3448.bin))
* Fast, linear pose, shape and expression fitting, edge and contour fitting:
  * Linear scaled orthographic projection camera pose estimation
  * Linear shape-to-landmarks fitting, implementation of O. Aldrian & W. Smith, _Inverse Rendering of Faces with a 3D Morphable Model_, PAMI 2013
  * Expression fitting, with 6 linear expression blendshapes of the SFM: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise
  * Edge-fitting, heavily inspired by: A. Bas et al., _Fitting a 3D Morphable Model to Edges: A Comparison Between Hard and Soft Correspondences_, ACCVW 2016
* Texture extraction to obtain a pose-invariant representation of the face texture
* **Python bindings**: Much of eos's functionality is available as a python module (try `pip install eos-py`!)
* (_Experimental_): Non-linear fitting cost functions using Ceres for shape, camera, blendshapes and the colour model (needs Ceres to be installed separately)

An experimental model viewer to visualise 3D Morphable Models and blendshapes is available [here](https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos-model-viewer).

## Usage

* Tested with the following compilers: >=gcc-9.4, >=Visual Studio 2019 (MSVC >=14.29), >=Xcode 15.2 (AppleClang >=15.0).
* The library and python bindings **do not require any external dependencies**. The example applications require cxxopts and OpenCV (>=4.0), which are installed via `vcpkg.json`.

To use the library in your own project, just add the following directories to your include path:

* `eos/include`
* `eos/3rdparty/cereal/include`
* `eos/3rdparty/nanoflann/include`
* `eos/3rdparty/eigen/Eigen`
* `eos/3rdparty/eigen3-nnls/src`
* `eos/3rdparty/toml11`

**Make sure to clone with `--recursive` to download the required submodules!**

### Build the examples and tests

* Needed dependencies for the example app: CMake (>=3.23), OpenCV core, imgproc, highgui (>=4.0), cxxopts.

To build:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos.git
mkdir build && cd build # creates a build directory next to the 'eos' folder
cmake -G "<your favourite generator>" ../eos -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install/
make && make install # or open the project file and build in an IDE like Visual Studio
```
It is strongly recommended to use [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) to install the dependencies on Windows. All modern IDEs support `vcpkg.json`. On the command-line, one can pass `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`=/path/to/vcpkg_root/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake - see the [vcpkg documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).
Users who wish to manage dependencies manually may need to populate `OpenCV_DIR` and potentially other `packagename_DIR` variables with the paths to their installations.
On Linux (if not using an IDE that manages CMake configurations), you may also want to set `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=...` appropriately.


## Sample code

The fit-model example app creates a 3D face from a 2D image.

After `make install` or running the `INSTALL` target, an example image with landmarks can be found in `install/bin/data/`. The model and the necessary landmarks mapping file are installed to `install/share/`.

You can run the example just by running:

`fit-model`

It will load the face model, landmark-to-vertex mappings, blendshapes, and other required files from the `../share/` directory, and run on the example image. It can be run on other images by giving it a `-i` parameter for the image and `-l` for a set of ibug landmarks. The full set of parameters can be viewed by running `fit-model --help`.

If you are just getting started, it is recommended to have a look at `fit-model-simple` too, as it requires much fewer input, and only fits pose and shape, without any blendshapes or edge-fitting. Its full set of arguments is:

`fit-model-simple -m ../share/sfm_shape_3448.bin -p ../share/ibug_to_sfm.txt -i data/image_0010.png -l data/image_0010.pts`

The output in both cases is an `obj` file with the shape and a `png` with the extracted texture map. The estimated pose angles and shape coefficients are available in the code via the API.

See [examples/fit-model.cpp](https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos/blob/master/examples/fit-model.cpp) for the full code.

## The Surrey Face Model

The library includes a low-resolution shape-only version of the Surrey Morphable Face Model. It is a PCA model of shape variation built from 3D face scans. It comes with uv-coordinates to perform texture remapping.

The full model is available at [http://www.cvssp.org/facemodel](http://www.cvssp.org/facemodel).

## 4D Face Model (4DFM)

eos can be used to load, use and do basic fitting with the 4D Face Model (4DFM) from [4dface Ltd](https://www.4dface.io). The model features 39 expressions/action units, and diverse identity variation.

More information about the model can be found on [www.4dface.io/4dfm](https://www.4dface.io/4dfm/).

## Python bindings

eos includes python bindings for some of its functionality (and more can be added!). It can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/eos-py/) with `pip install eos-py`. You will still need the data files from this repository.
Make sure that you've got >=gcc-9 or a recent clang as the default compiler on Linux (for example from the [ubuntu-toolchain-r/test](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-toolchain-r/+archive/ubuntu/test) repository) or do ``CC=`which gcc-xy` CXX=`which g++-xy` pip install eos-py``, where `xy` is your gcc version. Also make sure you've got >=cmake-3.23 in your path.
In case of issues, the bindings can also be built manually: Clone the repository and set `-DEOS_GENERATE_PYTHON_BINDINGS=on` when running `cmake` (and optionally set `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` to point to your python interpreter if it's not found automatically).

After having obtained the bindings, they can be used like any python module:

```
import eos
import numpy as np

model = eos.morphablemodel.load_model("eos/share/sfm_shape_3448.bin")
sample = model.get_shape_model().draw_sample([1.0, -0.5, 0.7])

help(eos) # check the documentation
```

See [`demo.py`](https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos/blob/master/python/demo.py) for an example on how to run the fitting.

## Matlab bindings

_Experimental (not maintained currently)_: eos includes Matlab bindings for the `fit_shape_and_pose(...)` function, which means the fitting can be run from Matlab. Set `-DEOS_GENERATE_MATLAB_BINDINGS=on` when running `cmake` to build the required mex-file and run the `INSTALL` target to install everything. (Set `Matlab_ROOT_DIR` to point to your Matlab directory if it's not found automatically). More bindings (e.g. the MorphableModel itself) might be added in the future.

Go to the `install/eos/matlab` directory and run [`demo.m`](https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos/blob/master/matlab/demo.m) to see how to run the fitting. The result is a mesh and rendering parameters (pose).

## Documentation

Doxygen: http://patrikhuber.github.io/eos/doc/

The [fit-model example](https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos/blob/master/examples/fit-model.cpp) and the [Namespace List](http://patrikhuber.github.io/eos/doc/namespaces.html) in doxygen are a good place to start.
